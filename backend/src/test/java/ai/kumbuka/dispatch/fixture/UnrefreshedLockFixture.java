/**
 * Locking reads, two of them deliberate violations, for {@code
 * LockedReadRefreshTest} to tell apart.
 *
 * <p>{@code lockedJpql} and {@code lockedNative} each take a row lock and
 * answer what the persistence context holds, which may be an object this
 * transaction read before the lock and another transaction has changed since.
 * The javadoc of {@code lockedJpql} names {@code underLock}, on purpose: the
 * guard reads code, and a mention in a comment does not refresh anything.
 *
 * <p>{@code locked} hands its lock mode to {@code at}, which refreshes, the
 * way {@code TaskRepository.lock} does; it is not a violation, and the guard
 * is required not to report it.
 *
 * <p>Lives in the test sources and is never wired into anything.
