/**
 * The token that proves a claim, minted by the service and never accepted from
 * a caller.
 *
 * <h2>Why the caller does not get to supply one</h2>
 *
 * The obvious design lets an executor name itself and be recognised by that
 * name. It fails in a way that is easy to miss and hard to debug: several
 * executor instances on one machine reach the service through one channel, and
 * anything they could derive a name from — hostname, working directory, start
 * time — collides. The service would then see one holder where there are two,
 * hand the claim to whichever asked last, and both would work.
 *
 * <p>A minted receipt cannot collide, because it is minted AFTER the award and
 * only one award happens. That is the whole argument, and it is why a
 * caller-supplied holder identifier is refused rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * <h2>What is stored</h2>
 *
 * A hash. The receipt is a bearer token in the literal sense, so the only copy
 * of the token itself is the one handed to the winner; every backup, dump and
 * replica of the database carries hashes and no working credentials.
